Azi-

I have added the slick2d libraries to the project.
We dont need half of these but i have no idea which are needed
I suggest we all pull down this branch then move the libraries to somewhere local
This will ensure we dont need to pull/push the whole set (which might take a while as its 32mb)
I can walk everyone through the config in a call
