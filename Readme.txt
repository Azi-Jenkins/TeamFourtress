Initial setup -- this will only work until we add more files to the project

Install gitbash
cygwin would probably also work

Install Eclipse Photon or Higher

Clone this git repo to a new directory

Create a new workspace in Eclipse

Right click inside Package Explorer and import

"Gradle","Existing Gradle Project"

Project Root Directory is wherever you cloned the repo to + \TeamFourtress\TeamFourtressGame

Dont override workspace settings and then click "Finish"
